Its been years that I wanted do this sort of shader. Was constrained by time, work and lack of math skills. 
Quarantine sort of changed all that. So I got around to doing it. Using resources from [GPU Gems 2](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems2/part-ii-shading-lighting-and-shadows/chapter-16-accurate-atmospheric-scattering), [Alan Zucconi's](https://www.patreon.com/AlanZucconi/) tutorial on the subject. 
I was able to make an implementaion, understand it and tweak it to produce a result that satisfied my aesthetic. 

There is more to be done in this project and I will eventually get to it. But for now there are more shaders to be made and more knowledge to be gained.
